To provide an encryption method to the Encrypt API module, you need to do a couple things:

<ol>
  
<li>
Implement <strong>hook_ctools_plugin_directory</strong> in your module. This simply tells ctools where to look for your module's plugins. Here is an example from Encrypt's own plugins.
<pre>
function encrypt_ctools_plugin_directory($module, $plugin) {
  if ($module == 'encrypt') {
    return 'plugins/' . $plugin;
  }
}
</pre>
So, with this implementation, ctools will look for encryption method plugins in <strong>plugins/encryption_methods</strong> and key provider plugins in <strong>plugins/key_providers</strong>. You can load plugins however you'd like, but this is sort of a ctools standard.
</li>

<li>
Create your plugin file. It should be a file called <strong>YOUR_PLUGIN.inc</strong> (where <strong>YOUR_PLUGIN</strong> is some machine-readable name for your plugin) inside the folder you declared above.
</li>

<li>
In your plugin file, declare your plugin. Here is an example from Encrypt's "Basic" encryption method.
<pre>
$plugin = array(
  'title' => t('Mcrypt AES 256'),
  'description' => t('This uses PHPs mcrypt extension and <a href="!url">AES-256</a>.', array('!url' => 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard')),
  'encrypt callback' => 'encrypt_encryption_methods_mcrypt_rij_256',
  'dependencies' => 'mcrypt_extension_is_present',
);
</pre>
The plugin can just be declared in the global space; no need to wrap it in a function or anything. Available options for the $plugin array include:
<dt>title</dt>
<dd><strong>Required</strong>. The human-readable name for your encryption method. This will appear on the Encrypt admin page.</dd>
<dt>description</dt>
<dd><strong>Required</strong>. A brief description of your encryption method. Also appears in smaller text on the Encrypt admin page.</dd>
<dt>encrypt callback</dt>
<dd><strong>Required</strong>. This is the name of a function that you define in your plugin file. Encrypt will use this function to encrypt and decrypt text for your encryption method.</dd>
<dt>dependencies</dt>
<dd>Optional. The name of a function in your plugin file that declares whether or not an encryption method's dependencies have been met. The function should return TRUE if the dependencies are met, and FALSE if they are not.</dd>
</li>

<li>
Create your encrypt/decrypt method. This is the function you declared in <strong>encrypt callback</strong> above. The function will have the following signature:
<pre>
/**
 * @param $op
 *  The operation currently being performed. 'encrypt' for encrypting, 'decrypt' for decrypting
 *
 * @param $text
 *  The string to be encrypted or decrypted.
 *
 * @param $key
 *  The encryption key to use for encrypting. Provided by the active key provider.
 *
 * @param $options
 *  An array of additional parameters.
 *
 * @return
 *  The processed (either encrypted or decrypted, depending on $op) string.
 */
function your_encryption_callback($op = 'encrypt', $text = '', $key, $options = array()) {
  // Do stuff.
}
</pre>
</li>

</ol>

All encryption method plugins are cached by ctools, so you may have to clear Drupal's cache for new plugins or changes to existing plugins to appear.
